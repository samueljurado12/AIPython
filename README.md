# AIPython
This repository has been made following the book *Artificial Intelligence with Python* by [Packt](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Artificial-Intelligence-with-Python).

The only difference is that some of the code from their repository is deprecated, so I will keep it updated as far as I advance with the book.

## Basic setup
Yo will need Python3, pip(package-manager for Python) and some libraries.
1. Install venv using ```pip install venv```.
2. Create a new folder for the project and type:
  ```
  cd my-project-folder
  virtualenv venv-name
  source venv-name/bin/activate
  ```
3. Install the packages numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib and scipy using:
  -```pip install package-name```
4. Install tkinter using:
  -```sudo apt-get install python-tk```
5. You are ready to start programming!!

## Contributing
This is not a personal project, but if I forget to update something, any help is welcomed.

##Licensing
All the code from this repository is available and has been made by [Packt](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Artificial-Intelligence-with-Python),
I just try to keep it clean and safe from deprecated functions and stuff like that.
